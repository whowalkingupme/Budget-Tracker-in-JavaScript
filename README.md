Main Components of the Budget Tracker
The budget tracker we will be creating now consists of several key components:

Local storage: We will use a browser’s local storage to store the user’s budget data.
Calculation logic: We will use JavaScript to calculate the user’s total income, expenses, and budget balance.
By adding these essential components, we will be able to create a functional budget tracker that allows users to easily input, store, and view their budget data. We will now go through the process of implementing each of these features in our budget tracker application.
